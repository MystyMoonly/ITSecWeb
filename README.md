This is a template for the information security literacy resourse, with the name ITSecurity. 
It is dedicated to literacy and awareness of information security issues for users of information systems. There are 8 basic principles of safe work with information, including on the Internet.

1 Secure passwords
2 The Dangers of Public Wi-Fi
3 Dangerous files and viruses
4 Email Security
5 Internet and social networks
6 Social engineering
7 Mobile devices
8 Phishing

A test has been compiled for each of the 8 topics to check yours awareness. 
And also a little crooked, but still checking passwords for compliance with the rules of a secure password(Beta).
